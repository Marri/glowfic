To Do

v1 (I want this done before release)
- Icon picker should have a dropdown with searchable keywords as well as the clickable icons
- When displaying a list of posts, each post should include links to its pages
- UI for posts: include poster moiety
- Being able to lock posts within public continuities (MWF, Sandboxes, etc) to specific authors, continuity-style
- Being able to delete multiple icons at once
- More complete profile pages, for users or characters or really whatever.
- List the allowed markup (<b>, <i>, etc) somewhere in the post editor
- Users can set their time zone
- More page titles
- Bug: changing characters can reset page somehow?
- Bug: still goes to page 1 when you post

v1.1 (I want this done before release but it comes last because $)
- Upload icons https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3
- Email users (optional thread notifications, password reset)

v2 (I can release without this but I want them)
- Caching so server doesn't rerender
- Unread page uses post list partial
- Improve icon view for characters page
- Improve character groups in full generality
    - Characters can be in multiple groups
    - Templates can be in multiple groups
    - Can choose which if any groups display on characters/index by default
    - Character/show displays all groups
- Handle weird facecast cases (ex: Sylvi)
- Allow users to select different layouts
- Email verification
- When changing or removing avatar, provide option to back-update all posts to use the new avatar
- Improve the gallery/icon UI in full generality
- UI for characters/index should somehow indicate which view is selected
- Add ability to tag a character with continuities, and if posting in a restricted continuity, filter to that continuity.
- CRUD for admin status
- Report Post option
- Tags for posts
- Being able to lock threads to specific authors or to specific visibilities, same as posts
- Expensive thing: store most recently updated post id on post, then use includes when you want it
- Expensive thing: cache users-by-post somewhere, or even posts-by-user, or both
- This is probably really hard to implement, but it would be super neat if, when you have a thread open and there's a new post, then the page updates automatically and optionally does a notification if you're in another tab/window. Built-in tag/update notifications.
- Next and Previous Thread In Continuity buttons

Finicky Tidiness
- clean up the css >_<
- clean up the javascript
- Move gon and json stuff to presenters
- display error messages as a neatly bulleted list
- Anything Javascript should be doable non-javascript (set default icon for character)

Scraper
- Handle internal links (see Milliways Lurks)

Tests
- Write them
- Fix weird error http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17936340/unresolved-specs-during-gemspecification-reset
