To Do

v1 (I want this done before release)
- Fix pagination display on posts/search
- Unread Posts filter for logged in users
- Icon picker should include a No Image option
- Icon picker should have a dropdown with searchable keywords as well as the clickable icons
- When displaying a list of posts, each post should include links to its pages
- UI for posts: include character username, poster moiety
- Page for logged in users to see threads where they might owe tags
- Being able to lock posts within public continuities (MWF, Sandboxes, etc) to specific authors, continuity-style
- Being able to delete multiple icons at once
- More complete profile pages, for users or characters or really whatever.
- Restricting what you can post, since right now I just let basically anything through and this is Not Safe, and then providing a list of allowed markup from the post form.
- Users can set their time zone
- More page titles
- Validate icon URLs

v1.1 (I want this done before release but it comes last because $)
- Upgrade the database so I can run the scraper
- Upload icons https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3
- Email users (optional thread notifications, password reset)

v2 (I can release without this but I want them)
- Improve icon view for characters page
- Improve character groups in full generality
    - Characters can be in multiple groups
    - Templates can be in multiple groups
    - Can choose which if any groups display on characters/index by default
    - Character/show displays all groups
- Handle weird facecast cases (ex: Sylvi)
- Allow users to select different layouts
- Email verification
- When changing or removing avatar, provide option to back-update all posts to use the new avatar
- Improve the gallery/icon UI in full generality
- UI for characters/index should somehow indicate which view is selected
- Add ability to tag a character with continuities, and if posting in a restricted continuity, filter to that continuity.
- CRUD for admin status
- Report Post option
- Tags for posts
- Being able to lock threads to specific authors or to specific visibilities, same as posts

Finicky Tidiness
- clean up the css >_<
- clean up the javascript
- Move gon and json stuff to presenters
- display error messages as a neatly bulleted list
- Anything Javascript should be doable non-javascript (set default icon for character)

Scraper
- Handle internal links (see Milliways Lurks)
