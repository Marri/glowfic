To Do

v1
- where do I display usernames for characters?
- post history
- Store sessions in the database
- Fix pagination display on posts/search

v2
- improve icon view for characters page
- improve character groups in full generality
- handle weird facecast cases (ex: Sylvi)

Images
- keyboard control: pick icon by typing its keyword (have a selectable keyword below the icon?)
- when changing avatar or icon keyword, provide option to back-update all posts
- Omg gallery/icon UI

User Settings
- ability to remove avatar, with back-update option

UI
- separate character picker / display names for characters
- how does characters/index visually display which view is selected?

Finicky Tidiness
- clean up the css >_<
- clean up the javascript
- flash.now vs flash
- Move gon and json stuff to presenters
- display error messages as a neatly bulleted list
- Anything Javascript should be doable non-javascript (set default icon for character)

Characters
- How does it handle posts with a character after that character is deleted? Ditto icons?
- Add ability to tag a character with continuities, and if posting in a restricted continuity, filter to that continuity.
- World (character groups?)

Questions
- Where do things go in a post? Character name and screenname, poster, timestamp, edit/delete buttons
- Do I need a 'picker' name for characters given that I have a screenname? Ideal: Name (screenname)?

Admin
- CRUD for admin status

Scraper
- Handle internal links (see Milliways Lurks)

V2
- tags for post (ex: setting)
